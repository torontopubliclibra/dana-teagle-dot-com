            "This application is a guided walking tour of historic locations for the 2SLGBTQAI+ community in Windsor-Essex, Ontario, built as a new implementation and update of the open-source Pytheas codebase.",

            "The research and organizing for this tour was provided by Walter Cassidy of the Windsor-Essex Rainbow Alliance. The Pytheas application is based on work originally developed for the McDougall Corridor tour app, built in partnership with the Essex County Black Historical Research Society, the Windsor Law Centre for Cities, the School of Creative Arts (SOCA), and Leddy Library, with funding provided by Canada's federal government through the Canadian Urban Institute."

Each round, the player chooses the stat from their card that they think is larger than the computer's and the winner of the challenge gets both cards. Gameplay continues until one deck is out of cards.",
