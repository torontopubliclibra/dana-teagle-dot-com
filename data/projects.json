All inputted data is stored locally in their browser without being sent to a database, so the notes are private and persistent across sessions until the user clears their cache. Notes can be sorted, filtered, edited, and deleted.",

The research and organizing for the tour was provided by Walter Cassidy of the Windsor-Essex Rainbow Alliance.",

The development of this implementation resulted in several significant functional upgrades to the open-source code base."

Each round, you choose the statistic from your card that you believe to be larger than your opponent's, and the winner of the challenge gets both cards. The game continues until one of the decks is empty.",
