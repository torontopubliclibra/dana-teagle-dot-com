Like many other business owners I'm not very literate about the language of websites and how I want something to look and feel. Dana's superpower is her ability to translate ideas; to hear what I'm saying and tell me what I mean. That seems simple but it unlocked all of our potential and a process that used to give me anxiety suddenly became fun. I've worked with many people and few have made me feel as at ease and confident as Dana.”"

In addition to quickly grasping the goals of the project, Dana anticipated obstacles and offered creative solutions to them. She always delivered on-time and to spec, and adapted to changing requirements. When communicating with management, teammates, and the client, Dana was clear and professional and she was able to work through any difficult situations that arose.”"
