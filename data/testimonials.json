As Online Comms Officer, I reached out to Dana for support on creating a bespoke site feature which we were struggling to find assistance for due to its technicalities. The feature Dana created for us exceeded every expectation and we are thoroughly impressed with her efficiency and knowledge with creating the feature, as well as her patience during the implementation stage which she provided a very helpful demo for. We will absolutely come back to Dana with any future similar site requirements and would highly recommend her to others. Such great work—thank you Dana!"

        "quote": "I consider myself a pretty articulate person but when it comes to communicating our vision for <a href='https://truehistorybeer.com' target='_blank' title='True History Brewing website'>TrueHistoryBeer.com</a>, we spent years lost in the wilderness. Like many other business owners I'm not very literate about the language of websites and how I want something to look and feel. Dana's superpower is her ability to translate ideas; to hear what I'm saying and tell me what I mean. That seems simple but it unlocked all of our potential and a process that used to give me anxiety suddenly became fun. I've worked with many people and few have made me feel as at ease and confident as Dana."

In addition to quickly grasping the goals of the project, Dana anticipated obstacles and offered creative solutions to them. She always delivered on-time and to spec, and adapted to changing requirements. When communicating with management, teammates, and the client, Dana was clear and professional and she was able to work through any difficult situations that arose."
