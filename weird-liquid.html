          <p>if I think about where I felt the most peace as a young person, my mind races to three specific places, all nested together in the downtown strip of the city where I grew up: the public library, the used book store, and the independent comic book shop. when I felt most alone and strange, when it felt like all my problems were unprecedented and no one understood me, there was always books. I think I found the woman I am today in those dusty volumes and plastic-wrapped single issues.</p>

          <p>much of the last six months my heart has felt heavy, my faith weak, I have held so much tension in my shoulders, and seen my hands curl to fists, but I still have zero desire to turn away or to turn off or to disengage from these liberation struggles of our time. I wholeheartedly refuse to believe I will find any self-care in ignorance.</p>

          <p>individuals enacting violence on a member of a vilified group is a horrifying reflection of the state and the media, but that vilified group applauding state violence and imprisonment in retribution is also a reflection of those same forces of power and it is terrifying to me the way that some queer and trans people (especially white ones) feel entitled to the brutal vengeance that carceral justice offers them.</p>

          <p>in my experience a lot of cis allies in Canada tell themselves they're doing everything in their power to help but that amounts mostly to "be respectful of trans people", not even "stand up for them when they're not around", let alone "defend and protect their fundamental rights" and that's precisely what's got us in this mess. we live in an increasingly dark reality for trans folks' legal rights in Canada, and I'm fucking scared even though I've been actively telling people this was coming for almost a decade.</p>

          <p>it's quite a time to be a queer trans woman... cishets want so badly to be queers while other queers want so badly to be trans femmes; our specific identities, cultures, and experiences rarely feel our own anymore, or even a topic on which we are recognized as an authority.</p>

          <p>I've said this before but I believe it bears repeating that many who speak passionately on issues online often have clearly failed to internalize that the discourse, causes, identities, and dynamics that are feeling ever so personal and specific and of the moment to them have existed and been long tired even prior to their learning about it 2-3 years ago. the more time you spend deep in libraries and archives and histories, whether paper or digital, the clearer the cyclical nature of it all becomes, and even more apparent than that is the need to defend and advocate for our legal and material rights above all else, including but not limited to inter-community squabbles.</p>

          <p>when we reduce where a trans person is at in their transition to "x # of years" we fail to take into account the ways that class, race, income, medical access, community, family, ability, social environment, and physical location impact our journeys. I see this as get further in my own transition (while I've been doing this for quite some time now, there are many transition steps I've never been able to access) but have watched others come out years after me and make far quicker strides forward than me. I'm still wildly more privileged than many other folks, and I am so happy for any person who is able to do everything they need in their own transition, but I just believe it's pretty vital to remember that comparing and contrasting ourselves on a single axis is never sufficient.</p>

          <p>I think so much discourse and personal conflict these days, especially online, can be seen more transparently when you recognize that many people are desperately grappling for coherent identity and community while being totally unaware what those things look like, and often are drawn into posturing and positioning themselves as trusted leaders and thinkers within those communities.</p>
          <p>self-appointed false authorities will try and convince you that it's them versus the world, and that solidarity is transactional, all the while using the language of intersectionality and coalition. I do not believe these folks will not lead you to revolution, but they will profit off of half-baked ideas and divisiveness. it's possibly never been more important to ask yrself who you consider trustworthy and why.</p>

          <p>my transsexuality is inextricably interwoven with my faith. I honour my God in the ongoing transformation of my body and soul, and every single day I labour and build myself toward a future defined by fluctuation and balance above all else.</p>

          <p>I'm the person I used to dream of being, even when I thought was a boy, even when I thought wanted to be a cis girl, even when thought there was only one way to transition. the person I wanted to be even when thought it was an impossible idea. I'm that person. I'm her.</p>

          <p>trans people live in cis society and are told to play by cis rules. our expressions are not only misunderstood and ridiculed but routinely dampened and dimmed. our existence is seen as an attack because it challenges the systems which the cis population are told is innate and natural. anti-trans concepts are so deeply entrenched that many cis folks, even those that believe they support us, view our love and care for one another as exclusionary and oppressive of them. but how could I possibly deny something to those who are given everything?</p>
          <p>I don't really desire trans politicians and trans leaders of government anymore; I increasingly desire trans society, because my vision of trans society is one where cis people could thrive, but I'm struggling to believe that trans people will never be able to fully exist in this cis society. the future that I want is not one where trans people are supreme in any way, but where trans people are considered in every aspect of life. where transition is seen for the magic it is, and not as a fix or a patch or a loss of innocence. this is our earth as well and we deserve to be seen as more than a denigration of the norm.</p>
