              Making neat things on the internet was a hobby for most of my life before it became my career in 2020. These days, I primarily build websites and apps for businesses, other freelancers, and non-profit organizations.</p>
            <p>
              I'm very passionate about accessible and equity-centered design, free and open-source software, data privacy, and projects that intersect with advocacy (particularly for queer and trans communities).

              Before I started coding full time, I spent years cooking in vegetarian restaurants, managing caf√©s, creating graphics for social media, and editing short films. I studied botany for a time, and I also have experience consulting on technical solutions for small businesses and leading workshops for 2SLGBTQ+ folks.</p>
            <p>
              I'm a lifelong science-fiction nerd, former comic book collector, and current cassette tape collector. When I'm away from my keyboard, chances are I'm <a href="/spotify" target="_blank" title="Dana's Spotify profile">making playlists</a>, <a href="/goodreads" target="_blank" title="Dana's Goodreads profile">reading library books</a>, <a href="/letterboxd" target="_blank" title="Dana's Letterboxd profile">watching movies</a>, or walking around the city taking photos of pigeons.

              I've described some potential scenarios below to help you get a sense of what your project might be and what work it could entail. These five (5) options are grouped into three (3) sections based on size and scope: consultation, small projects, and medium-to-large projects. However, every project is unique, so please don't hesitate to reach out if you have something else in mind.
            </p>
            <div class="service">
              <h3>Consultation</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <h4>Website audit</h4>
                  <p>I do a full review of the design, layout, content, and functionality of your existing website, and walk you through what you're doing well and what you can do better. Possible suggested changes could include: increasing accessibility compliance, ensuring all of your content is written in a clear and concise manner, and improving the user experience (UX).</p>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Small projects</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <h4>Design & build</h4>
                  <p>I design a custom site with 1-3 self-hosted web pages. If your site has content that will rarely change, I build the site with static and hard-coded content. If you foresee yourself making frequent updates, I build the site using a Content Management System (CMS), allowing you to update your own content as needed.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h4>Site migration</h4>
                  <p>I re-create the layout and content of an existing site you've previously built using a web builder such as Squarespace or Wix. I provide updated designs for 1-3 self-hosted web pages, and build it with either static content or a CMS. The migrated sites I develop tend to have lower monthly costs than most web builder plans.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Medium-to-large projects</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <h4>Design & build</h4>
                  <p>I design a multi-page custom website, and build it with advanced functionality (e.g., calendars, mapping, animated graphics, user verification, etc.) using a combination of a web development framework and a CMS.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h4>Design & build (+ e-commerce)</h4>
                  <p>I design a multi-page custom website, and build it with advanced functionality (including e-commerce) using a combination of a web development framework, a headless storefront, and a CMS.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <p>
              When we decide to move forward with your project, I will often create several custom mockups and wireframes that fit your branding and aesthetic. I tweak the designs further based on a round of your feedback, and then begin building the site with a tech stack (custom combination of languages, platforms, and frameworks) that fits the specific needs of your project.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
              I develop all of my projects with consideration for responsiveness (functioning seamlessly across devices), search engine optimization, and web accessibility. I also rigorously test for usability and performance before launch to ensure every potential user gets the ideal browsing experience.
