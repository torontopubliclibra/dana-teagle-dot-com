              Making neat things on the internet was a hobby for most of my life before it became my career in 2020. I currently work with clients on a contract basis, primarily building websites and apps for businesses and non-profit organizations. Please feel free to check out my <a href="/data/DanaRosamundTeagleResume-281123.pdf" target="_blank" title="Download Dana's resume (last updated 28/11/23)">most recent resume</a>. These days I'm most passionate about accessible and equity-centered design, free and open-source software, data privacy, and projects that intersect with advocacy (particularly for queer and trans communities).

              Before I started coding full time, I spent years cooking in vegetarian restaurants, managing caf√©s, creating graphics for social media, and editing short films. I studied botany for a time, and I also have experience consulting on technical solutions for small businesses and leading workshops for 2SLGBTQ+ folks. I'm a lifelong science-fiction nerd, former comic book collector, and current cassette tape collector. When I'm away from my keyboard, chances are I'm <a href="/spotify" target="_blank" title="Dana's Spotify profile">making playlists</a>, <a href="/goodreads" target="_blank" title="Dana's Goodreads profile">reading library books</a>, <a href="/letterboxd" target="_blank" title="Dana's Letterboxd profile">watching movies</a>, or walking around the city taking photos of pigeons.

              I am currently taking on freelance projects for web and software design, development, and auditing. <a href="#contact">Get in touch</a> to schedule a free 15-minute virtual meeting where we can discuss your goals, deadline, and budget in more detail, and collaborate on mapping out your dream website.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
              Once we have collaborated on your vision and decide to move forward on the design and development of your site, I will create several custom mockups and wireframes that fit your branding and aesthetic. I'll tweak the designs further based on a round of your feedback before starting the development phase.
            </p>
            <p>
              I then choose a technology stack (the combination of languages, platforms, and frameworks that I'll be using to develop your custom site). I build all my projects with consideration for responsiveness (looking and functioning seamlessly across devices), SEO optimization, and web accessibility. I also rigorously test the usability and performance before launch to ensure each and every potential user gets the intended and ideal browsing experience.

              I've described some common site options below to help you get a sense of what your project might be and what work it will entail. The five options are grouped into three sections based on size and scope: consultation, small projects, and medium-to-large projects.
            </p>
            <div class="service">
              <h3>Consultation</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <h4>Website audit</h4>
                  <p>I will do a full review of the design, layout, content, and functionality of your existing website, and walk you through what you're doing well and what you can do better. Possible suggested changes could include increasing accessibility compliance, ensuring all of your content is written in a clear and concise manner, and improving the user experience (UX).</p>

              <ul>

                  <h4>Design & build</h4>
                  <p>I will build a custom site designed with 1-3 self-hosted web pages. If your site has content that will rarely change, I will build the site with static and hard-coded content. If you foresee yourself making frequent updates, I will build the site using a Content Management System (CMS), allowing you to update your own content as needed.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h4>Site migration</h4>
                  <p>I will re-create the content of an existing site you've previously built using a web builder such as Squarespace or Wix. I provide updated designs for 1-3 self-hosted web pages, and build it with either static content or a CMS. The migrated sites I develop tend to have lower monthly costs than most web builder plans.</p>

                  <h4>Design & build</h4>
                  <p>I will build a multi-page custom website developed with more advanced functionality (e.g., calendars, mapping, animated graphics, user verification, etc.) using a combination of a web development framework and a CMS.</p>
