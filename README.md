## About
[danateagle.com](https://danateagle.com/) is my web/software design & development portfolio, built with jQuery, HTML, and SCSS. The data for each of the portfolio projects is stored as JSON for ease of iterating, filtering, and updating.

A [second page](https://danateagle.com/share) also serves as a landing site (similar to a Linktree) for sharing external links, iterated from another JSON file.

## Development
The site was originally developed in Oct 2022, redesigned and refactored in Aug and Sept 2023, and continues to be updated and improved periodically.
