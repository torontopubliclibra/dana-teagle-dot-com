## About
[dana teagle dot com](https://danateagle.com/) is my portfolio website. I built it using HTML, SCSS, and jQuery. The data for each of the portfolio projects is stored as a JSON object for ease of iterating, filtering, and updating.

## Development
The site was originally built in Oct 2022, and was most recently redesigned and refactored in Aug and Sept 2023.
