## About
[danateagle.com](https://danateagle.com/) is my web design/development profile & portfolio built with jQuery, HTML, and SCSS. The data for each of the portfolio projects is stored as a JSON object for ease of iterating, filtering, and updating.

A second page also serves as a landing site, similar to a Linktree, for sharing external links (iterated from a seperate JSON object). It's accessible either at a subdomain ([/share](https://danateagle.com/share)) or redirected from my secondary domain ([torontopubliclibra.com](http://torontopubliclibra.com)).

## Development
The site was originally developed in Oct 2022, redesigned and refactored in Aug and Sept 2023, and continues to be updated and improved periodicly.
