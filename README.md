## About
This is the repository for a few different webpages that relate to my work and life. The websites are all built with jQuery, HTML, and SCSS.

### Web/software developer portfolio
The main page is for my design and web/software development portfolio. The data for each of the projects is stored as JSON for ease of iterating, filtering, and updating. This page is available in both [default](https://danateagle.com/) and [classic](https://danateagle.com/classic) view.

### The Toronto Public Libra
The [second page](https://danateagle.com/alt) is a list of various external links (all iterated from another JSON file).

### Trans I.D. Resources
The [third page](https://danateagle.com/trans-id) is a download hub for documents and resources regarding changing your name and/or gender marker in Ontarioâ€”this is an extension of my work running virtual presentations for the trans community since 2020. I'm currently in the early stages of developing a new permanent home for these resources, where users will be able to request info and submit their own suggestions to a team of moderators.

## Development
I originally built my portfolio page in Oct 2022. I did a major redesign and refactor of the website in Aug and Sept 2023, and I continue to update and improve it pretty regularly.
