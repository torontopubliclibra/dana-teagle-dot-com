## About
This is the repository for a few different webpages that relate to my work and life. The websites are all built with jQuery, HTML, and SCSS.

## Development
I originally built my portfolio page in Oct 2022. I did a major redesign and refactor of the website in Aug and Sept 2023, and I continue to update and improve it pretty regularly.
