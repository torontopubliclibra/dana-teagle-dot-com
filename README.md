## About
[danateagle.com](https://danateagle.com/) is my web design/development profile & portfolio. I built it with jQuery, HTML, and SCSS. The data for each of the portfolio projects is stored as a JSON object for ease of iterating, filtering, and updating.

A second page serves as a landing site for sharing links (also iterated from a JSON object), and accessible either at a subdomain ([/share](https://danateagle.com/share)) or redirected from my secondary domain ([torontopubliclibra.com](http://torontopubliclibra.com)).

## Development
The site was originally developed in Oct 2022, redesigned and refactored in Aug and Sept 2023, and continues to be updated periodicly.
