## About
This is the repository for a few different webpages that relate to the work, projects, and advocacy of Dana Teagle. The sites are all built with jQuery, HTML, and SCSS.

### Web/software developer portfolio
The [main page](https://danateagle.com/) is for my web/software design & development portfolio. The data for each of the projects is stored as JSON for ease of iterating, filtering, and updating.

### The Toronto Public Libra
The [second page](https://danateagle.com/alt) is a list of various external links (all iterated from another JSON file).

### Trans I.D. Resources
The [third page](https://danateagle.com/trans-id-resources) is a download hub for documents and resources for changing your name and/or gender marker in Ontarioâ€”an extension of my work running virtual presentations for the transgender community since 2020.

I'm currently in the early stages of developing a new permanent home for these resources, where users will be able to request info and submit their own suggestions to a team of moderators.

## Development
I originally built my portfolio page in Oct 2022. I redesigned and refactored the website in Aug and Sept 2023, and I continue to update and improve it periodically.
