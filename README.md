## About
This is the repository for a few different webpages that relate to my work and life:
- [dana teagle dot com](https://danateagle.com)—my design and web/software development portfolio,
- [the toronto public libra](https://danateagle.com/tpl)—a landing page for my various links and projects, and
- [RUSTPROP](https://danateagle.com/rustprop)—an agitprop design project.

The pages are all built with jQuery, HTML, and SCSS, and some of them use JSON to store data and efficiently render repeated components. RUSTPROP also has an [XML RSS webfeed](https://danateagle.com/rustprop/rss.xml).

## Development
I originally built my portfolio page in Oct 2022. I did a major redesign and refactor of the website in Aug and Sept 2023, and I continue to update and improve it pretty regularly.
