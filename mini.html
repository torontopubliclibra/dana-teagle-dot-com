      <p>
        I've spent most of my life creating things online—building websites and software, designing graphics and posters, managing social media, and editing video content. I'm passionate about hand-coded sites, accessible and user-friendly interfaces, and open-source projects, especially those connected to advocacy and community work.
      </p>
      <p>
        These days, I mostly work as an independent contractor for businesses, academics, freelance professionals, artists, and non-profits. I also partner on larger software and consulting projects with <a href="https://www.p42systems.com" target="_blank" title="P42 website">Parallel 42 Systems</a>, and provide ongoing help for clients like <a href="https://www.connectfund.org/" target="_blank" title="Connect Fund website">Connect Fund</a>, <a href="https://www.foriaclinic.com/" target="_blank" title="Foria Clinic website">Foria Clinic</a>, and <a href="https://skyship.tv/" target="_blank" title="Skyship Entertainment website">Skyship Entertainment</a>.

        Beyond design and development, I've worked in short film and TV editing, restaurant management, technical consulting, and I've led workshops and given talks for organizations including <a href="https://www.camh.ca/" target="_blank" title="CAMH website">CAMH</a>, <a href="https://www.youthline.ca/" target="_blank" title="LGBT YouthLine website">LGBT YouthLine</a>, <a href="https://www.hackf.org/" target="_blank" title="Windsor Hackforge website">Windsor Hackforge</a>, <a href="https://www.cupe3902.org/" target="_blank" title="CUPE 3902 website">CUPE 3902</a>, and <a href="https://cupe3903.org/" target="_blank" title="CUPE 3903 website">CUPE 3903</a>.

      <p>
        I offer freelance web and software development, graphic design, digital content strategy, and website audits. <a href="#contact" class="services-to-contact">Contact me</a> to discuss your goals, timeline, and budget. I enjoy helping clients turn ideas into reality, whether you need a full site build, a design refresh, or ongoing support.

      <p>
        My web projects are responsive, accessible, and optimized for search engines. I prioritize usability, performance, and equity-centered design, ensuring a great experience for all users.
      </p>
      <hr class="blue-dash">
      <p>
        I work with a wide range of languages—HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, PHP, Ruby, C#—and frameworks like React, Next.js, Vue, Angular, Node.js, Wordpress, and Shopify. I'm also comfortable with a variety of design tools including Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, Affinity Designer, and Figma. My approach is flexible, and I'm always open to learning new technologies to meet client needs.
      </p>
      <hr class="blue-dash">
      <p>
        For development projects, I begin with a discovery phase to understand your needs and goals. I then create a project roadmap and provide a quote based on estimated work and your budget. Larger projects are typically milestone-based, while smaller tasks, maintenance, design, and consulting are billed hourly. I also offer long-term maintenance, troubleshooting, and updates for existing sites.

        <blockquote><em>"I consider myself a pretty articulate person but when it comes to communicating our vision for <a href='https://truehistorybeer.com' target='_blank' title='True History Brewing website'>TrueHistoryBeer.com</a>, we spent years lost in the wilderness. Like many other business owners I'm not very literate about the language of websites and how I want something to look and feel. Dana's superpower is her ability to translate ideas; to hear what I'm saying and tell me what I mean. That seems simple but it unlocked all of our potential and a process that used to give me anxiety suddenly became fun. I've worked with many people and few have made me feel as at ease and confident as Dana."</em></blockquote>

        <blockquote><em>"Hackforge engaged Dana to lead the development team implementing <a href='https://queerwalk.ca' target='_blank' title='Queer Walk website'>QueerWalk.ca</a> in spring/summer 2023 and she was an absolute pleasure to work with. In addition to quickly grasping the goals of the project, Dana anticipated obstacles and offered creative solutions to them. She always delivered on-time and to spec, and adapted to changing requirements. When communicating with management, teammates, and the client, Dana was clear and professional and she was able to work through any difficult situations that arose."</em></blockquote>

        <blockquote><em>"Working with Dana on developing <a href='https://www.michaelcduguay.com/' target='_blank' title='Michael Cloud Duguay website'>my website</a> was a notably positive experience. Her aesthetic vision is distinct and focused and she guided me through the technical aspects with transparency and in a collaborative spirit that I really appreciated. Her communication was punctual and respectful and we met all deadlines on time. I will continue to work with Dana for all of my web design needs, and recommend her to any of my peers needing this sort of work. I love the website that she designed for me."</em></blockquote>

I can't recommend her enough; her knowledge in accessibility and design sets her apart and makes the entire experience seamless."</em></blockquote>

As Online Comms Officer, I reached out to Dana for support on creating a bespoke site feature which we were struggling to find assistance for due to its technicalities. The feature Dana created for us exceeded every expectation and we are thoroughly impressed with her efficiency and knowledge with creating the feature, as well as her patience during the implementation stage which she provided a very helpful demo for. We will absolutely come back to Dana with any future similar site requirements and would highly recommend her to others. Such great work—thank you Dana!"</em></blockquote>
