None of us are free until all of us are free."/><br/>all of our liberation is inextricably intertwined. there is no pride in policing. there is no pride in genocide. land back now. corporations are not your ally. uplift trans women of colour while they are alive. free palestine and free sudan and free congo and free every oppressed peoples from the tyranny of colonial white supremacist ideology and extraction. queer/trans liberation cannot be divorced from class struggle and don't you forget it.]]></description>
